Hey thanks for reading this!

This is the eBay_variation code.

Which you have to create a links.txt in the directory and have all the eBay variations links in them before running the code.

After running it gives the progress bar and in the finised you'll see output.xlsx in that you've got all the headers and their values in their!

Thanks.
